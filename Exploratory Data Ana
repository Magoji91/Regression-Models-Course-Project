The exploratory analysis of data will investigate through the use of regression models which transmission is more economical if it is automatic or manual. But for this:

I-) Transform variables into factors.

mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c('Automatic','Manual'))
